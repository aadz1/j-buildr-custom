# j-buildr-custom

The custom.less file is the reusable (core) customization file for the Joomla template framework.

The LESS variables at the top of the file can be modified on a project by project basis.

Further costomizations, that are specific to the individual website/template, should be placed below the core customization code in the custom.less file.
